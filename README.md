# Account Sorting Project

This C project reads account data, sorts it based on your preferences, and saves the results to a file. The way it works is by taking account numbers, names, and balances from a file, allowing you to choose how you want them sorted, and then displaying and saving the sorted data in a structured format.

You can sort the accounts in three different ways: by account number, alphabetically by name, or by balance in descending order. The interactive prompt makes it easy to select your preferred sorting method. Once sorted, the data is displayed in a structured format, and if needed, it can be saved to a new text file for future reference.

I built this project as a way to practice file handling and sorting techniques while working with structured data. Organizing information efficiently is a key part of many applications, and this project provided a great opportunity to explore different sorting methods and optimize their implementation. My goal was to create a tool that makes sorting account data simple, intuitive, and efficient.

## Example Output

1 - Sort by Account Number
